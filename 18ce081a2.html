IMDb (Internet Movie Database)[2] is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos, video games, and streaming content online â€“ including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, fan and critical reviews, and ratings. An additional fan feature, message boards, was abandoned in February 2017. Originally a fan-operated website, the database is owned and operated by IMDb.com, Inc., a subsidiary of Amazon.

As of January 2020, IMDb has approximately 6.5 million titles (including episodes) and 10.4 million personalities in its database,[3] as well as 83 million registered users.

IMDb began as a movie database on the Usenet group "rec.arts.movies" in 1990 and moved to the web in 1993.</p></div>
